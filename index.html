        <p>Welcome to my first project! This was built in <strong>Sketch</strong> shortly after learning the basic skills of design. The project was a website for a fictional app that eradicates your bureaucratic nightmares. There are four different device-sizes

        <h3 id="js">💭 Programming With JavaScript: Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying And Love The Debugger 💭</h3>
        <span id="js-txt"><p>Hey <span class="hacker">hacker friends!</span><br>Ur fam; <a href="mailto:me@l0rdcafe.com">l0rdcafe</a> here. This installment is about <strong>JavaScript</strong>, or in other words my first foray into proper programming.</p>
        <p>Two weeks ago, I had little to no programming experience whatsoever. I’d read a few tutorials and seen some <strong>JavaScript</strong> syntax, enough to scare me away from programming for browsers. However, I decided it was time to face my fears
          and program for the web.</p>
        <p>I started off by reading and doing the <a href="http://asmarterwaytolearn.com/js/index-of-exercises.html" target="_blank">exercises</a> for <a href="http://www.asmarterwaytolearn.com/" target="_blank">A Smarter Way To Learn: JavaScript by Mark Myers</a>;
          a quick and to the point programming book that teaches you the foundations of the language whilst maintaining basic practicality. After finishing the book, I signed up and completed the <a href="https://watchandcode.com/p/practical-javascript"
            target="_blank">Practical JavaScript</a> course at <a href="https://watchandcode.com/" target="_blank">Watch and Code,</a> building a basic to-do list with the instructor. Where he goes into thorough explanation of all aspects of the program
          in an intuitive and practical way.</p>
        <p>Beyond the <a href="https://watchandcode.com/p/practical-javascript" target="_blank">Watch and Code tutorial,</a> I decided to implement some extra features to the application like <strong>expired items, urgent items, item counters</strong> and
          other
          <strong>UI features.</strong> That proved to be the most educational part of the process as I encountered every programmer’s best friends; <strong>bugs.</strong></p>
        <p>I quickly learned that you constantly need to maintain a <em>readable, consistent</em> and <strong>focused codebase</strong> to simplify <strong>debugging</strong>, adding features and most of all avoid mistakes. Moreover, I also learned that
          <strong>refactoring</strong> is necessary as a program gets bigger, and the usage of <strong>helper methods</strong> and/or <strong>functions</strong> comes into play much more prominently as an application expands.</p>
        <p>One of the more challenging undertakings of the application was <strong>date validation</strong>, but from Mark Myers’ e-mail address validation explanation in <a href="http://www.asmarterwaytolearn.com/" target="_blank">A Smarter Way To Learn: JavaScript,</a>          some stubbornness, and a lot of persistence, I managed to validate the date input to the desired format and also list items as either <strong>‘Urgent’</strong> or <strong>‘Expired’</strong> according to their due dates.</p>
        <p>Another essential ally in my programming endeavor was a browser’s <strong>debugger</strong> and <strong>console</strong>. Using the <strong>debugger</strong> to pause the program at specific points to catch <strong>bugs,</strong> going through
          the program line and line, stepping in and out of <strong>functions,</strong> and examining the program’s behavior. As well as <strong>logging variables, calling functions</strong> and others in the <strong>console</strong> to ensure everything
          runs, as it ought to.</p>
        <p>Finally, and after much effort I had finished my <a href="2-do">2-Do List</a> with the features and functionality that I intended it to have. I’ve always disliked boasting, but I got to say that I do feel proud in this first moment of programming
          victory.

        <h3 id="dsgn">💭 Hacking Graphic Design or Sketch for Devs 💭</h3>
        <span id="dsgn-txt"><p>Hey <span class="hacker">hackers</span>, <span class="hacker">designers</span> and <span class="hacker">design hackers.</span><br>It's your boy <a href="mailto:me@l0rdcafe.com">l0rdcafe</a>. This post is a brief overview
        of my experience learning graphic design basics with <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com/" target="_blank">Sketch.</a> I'll be going through what I learned, built, and how useful these new skills are.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.sketchapp.com/" target="_blank">Sketch</a> is a lighter and more affordable alternative to <a href="http://www.adobe.com/ca/products/photoshop.html" target="_blank">Adobe Photoshop.</a> <a href="https://www,sketchapp.com"
            target="_blank">Sketch</a> simplifies some tasks that otherwise would be rather complicated to execute in other applications.</p>
        <p>It's also an extremely light application and moreover, allows you to copy the <strong>CSS</strong> of any <strong>asset</strong> to the clipboard and paste it to a <strong>text editor</strong>. Compared to <a href="http://www.adobe.com/ca/products/photoshop.html"
            target="_blank">Photoshop</a> or other graphic design software, the <strong>CSS</strong> given by <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com" target="_blank">Sketch</a> is incredibly clean, easily readable and concise.</p>
        <p>Secondly,I used <a href="https://www.lynda.com/">Lynda</a> to complete a series of 4 <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com" target="_blank">Sketch</a> courses. Starting off with <a href="https://www.lynda.com/Sketch-tutorials/Learn-Sketch-Basics/450912-2.html"
            target="_blank">Sketch Essential Training: The Basics,</a> and designing the mockup website with the instructor using the downloadable exercise files. I quickly picked up on the basics of <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com" target="_blank">Sketch</a>          and hardly found anything too cumbersome to do.</p>
        <p>From creating <strong>artboards, to drawing vector icons, creating symbols,</strong> and finally building a responsive website for 4 devices. This course covered the essential <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com" target="_blank">Sketch</a> basics
          to be able to create, edit and export <strong>assets</strong> for web development or other purposes.</p>
        <p>Afterwards, I completed the <a href="https://www.lynda.com/Sketch-tutorials/Learn-Sketch-Creating-Vector-Graphics/496907-2.html?srchtrk=index%3a11%0alinktypeid%3a2%0aq%3asketch%0apage%3a1%0as%3arelevance%0asa%3atrue%0aproducttypeid%3a2" target="_blank">Sketch: Creating Vector Graphics</a>          course, which gets more into <strong>vector graphics</strong> in terms of drawing, editing, custom borders, <strong>Bezier vectors, Boolean operations</strong> and that culminated in building an average navigation toolbar.</p>
        <p>The penultimate course named the <a href="https://www.lynda.com/Sketch-tutorials/Learn-Sketch-Style-Guides-Pattern-Libraries/496908-2.html" target="_blank">Sketch: Style Guides & Asset Libraries</a> concerned <strong>style guides, asset libraries</strong>          and how to manage and build them both efficiently as well as professionally. By the end of the course, I'd learned how to build my own <strong>asset library</strong> by combining other libraries, how to properly name <strong>assets</strong>          and organize them in case of collaborative work, and finally how to share <strong>asset libraries</strong> with others.</p>
        <p>Lastly, <a href="https://www.lynda.com/Sketch-tutorials/UX-Design-Tools-Sketch/505807-2.html?srchtrk=index%3a1%0alinktypeid%3a2%0aq%3asketch+ux+design%0apage%3a1%0as%3arelevance%0asa%3atrue%0aproducttypeid%3a2" target="_blank">Sketch for UX Design</a>          was the last course I finished and it was almost an aggregate of all the aforementioned skills giving a broad outline of <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com" target="_blank">Sketch</a> and how it can be utilized to build for a range of devices
          including the likes of <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/watch/?afid=p238%7CsiRW00CTe-dc_mtid_2092506t42625_pcrid_187244146446_&cid=wwa-ca-kwgo-watch-slid-" target="_blank">Apple Watch</a>. Also, the course gets into several
          <strong>plugins,</strong> <a href="https://www.sketchappsources.com/" target="_blank">Sketch App Sources</a> and how the <a href="http://sketchtoolbox.com/" target="_blank">Sketch Toolbox</a> can be used to install a plethora of <strong>plugins</strong>          created by the vibrant <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com/community/" target="_blank">Sketch community.</a></p>
        <p>To wrap up, <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com" target="_blank">Sketch</a> is an impressively user-friendly tool that allows <span class="hacker">designers,</span> and <span class="hacker">developers</span> to quickly draw up <strong>mockups</strong>,
          create <strong>icons,</strong> <strong>assets, asset libraries,</strong> among numerous other functions. With my newly-acquired <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com" target="_blank">Sketch</a> nous, I made a fairly simple <a href="mailto:me@l0rdcafe.com">l0rdcafe</a>          logo <a href="#flex-side" class="c">(See?)</a> as well as a mockup responsive design of a website for a fictional app for 4 devices in the
          <a href="#uber">projects</a> section.</p>

        <h3 id="newdev">💭 How To Setup Your Macbook Pro To Be More Efficient for Editing Code (For New Web Devs) 💭</h3>
        <span id="dev-txt"><p>Hey <span class="hacker">hacker friends!</span><br>It’s <a href="mailto:me@l0rdcafe.com">l0rdcafé</a>. I fleetingly mentioned the term <strong>tech stack</strong> in the previous post. Here, we go deeper into that and how
        to set up a well-organized workflow especially for new web developers on Mac.</p>

          <li><i class="fa fa-square"></i><a href="#itrm">iTerm2</a></li>
          <li><i class="fa fa-square"></i><a href="#brew">Homebrew</a></li>

        </ol>
        <h4 id="itrm">iTerm2</h4>
        <p>If you’re still using the default <strong>Mac Terminal</strong>, bin that instantly and download <a href="https://iterm2.com/" target="_blank">iTerm2</a>. Press <strong>Cmd-N</strong>, instant improvement, right?</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.iterm2.com/" target="_blank">iTerm2</a> unlike <strong>Terminal</strong>, is very customizable. So give the preferences a look and toy with the colors. Additionally, you can download <a href="http://iterm2colorschemes.com/"
            target="_blank"> preset color schemes</a>.<img src="assets/colors.gif"></p>
        <h4 id="brew">Homebrew</h4>
        <p>Before you go any further, you should install <a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank">Homebrew</a>. It'll give you quick access to a plethora of software by running simple commands, dubbed as the missing package manager for macOS. Copy/paste
          the command into your terminal.</p>
        <h4 id="node">Node</h4>
        <p>Up next is <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">Node,</a> which after installing <a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank">Homebrew</a> becomes a much simpler task. Run <code>brew install node</code>. Now, run <code>node -v</code>          to see if it's installed, and then also <code>npm -v</code>. If it is, you should see something similar to this.</p><img src="assets/node.png" class="node">
        <h4 id="tldr">Easier to read Manual Pages</h4>
        <p>If you know some basic
          <strong>UNIX command line</strong> and know about the <code>man</code> pages, which are notoriously dizzying to read, then you should start off by installing <a href="https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr" target="_blank">tldr</a>. Simply run <code>sudo npm install –g tldr</code>,
          then run <code>tldr echo</code> to see if it works. The <code>sudo</code> prefix might not be necessary, depending on your admin preferences. But if you run the command without it and returns an error, then it will be.
        </p>
        <h4 id="zsh">Shell Setup with Prezto</h4>
        <p>The default <strong>Shell</strong> is <code>.bash</code>, which isn’t necessarily the most efficient. You can tell which <strong>Shell</strong> is running by looking at the top of your terminal window.</p><img src="assets/bash.png" class="node">
        <p>That’s where <a href="https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto" target="_blank">Prezto</a> comes into play, a <code>.zsh</code> <strong>framework</strong> enriching the command line interface with <strong>aliases</strong>, <strong>sane defaults</strong>,
          <strong>prompt themes</strong> and most importantly <strong>auto completion</strong>; a true savior!</p>
        <p>Run <code>zsh</code> to start a <code>.zsh</code> session and follow the installation instructions carefully.</p>
        <p>As with most things, you'll need to customize your <a href="https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto" target="_blank">Prezto</a> modules. So go to your home directory by running <code>cd</code>, then run <code>ls -a</code> and check to see if there's
          a <code>.zpreztorc</code>. If there is and there should be, open that file in your <strong> text editor</strong>and make sure the modules from line 26 to 44 are in the following order.</p><img src="assets/module.png" class="node">
        <h4 id="j">Faster Directory Navigation</h4>
        <p>Moreover, if you’ve used the <code>cd</code> command enough, you’ll know how consuming directory navigation can be. Run <code>brew install fasd</code> and now you can use the command <code>j</code> with any <strong>directory</strong> that you’ve
          visited before as its <strong>argument</strong> to navigate instantly there. Here's an example of it in action.</p><img src="assets/fasd.gif" class="node">
        <h4 id="brwsr">Efficient CSS Workflow</h4>
        <p>Writing <strong>CSS</strong> can be a pain when you have to refresh the page on your browser with each saved change. That’s why <a href="https://browsersync.io/" target="_blank">browser-sync</a> exists, run <code>sudo npm install –g browser-sync</code>,
          then <code>tldr browser-sync</code> <a href="#src">(Aha!)</a> for examples on how to use it.</p><img src="assets/browser-sync.gif" class="node">
        <h4 id="lntrs">Linters and Text Editor Plugins</h4>
        <p>Now it’s time to upgrade your <strong>text editor</strong>. Personally, I picked <a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank">Atom</a> at the start and have been using it ever since, so this is going to be catered to that but feel free to look up
          equivalent upgrades for whatever <strong>text editor</strong> you end up choosing. <strong>Linters</strong> are packages installed in a <strong>text editor</strong> that, given specific settings will clean up your code and pick up on any syntax
          errors. This is a pretty long list, since you have to install <strong>linters</strong> for each language. However, I highly advise against copy/pasting and to actually type in each command.</p>
        <code class="lntr l-lntr">
                  apm install linter-csslint<br>
                  apm install linter-htmlhint<br>
                  apm install linter-jsonlint<br>
                  apm install linter-scss-lint<br>
                  apm install linter-markdown<br>
                  apm install linter-eslint<br>
                  apm install linter-stylefmt<br>
                  apm install linter-write-good<br>
                  apm install atom-beautify<br>
                  apm install git-diff<br>
                  apm install jquery<br>
                  apm install pigments<br>
                  apm install file-type-icons<br>
                  apm install open-recent</code>
        <p>You will need to customize some of these plugins. Firstly, create a <code>~/.eslintrc</code> file and write the following in it.</p><img src="assets/eslintrc.png" class="node">
        <p>Then your beautify settings should match those in the following image.</p><img src="assets/beautify.png" class="node">
        <p>You'll also need to tick the box for Use global ESLint installation as well as specify the <strong>.eslintrc Path</strong> to the <code>~/.eslintrc</code> file created earlier. You can implement these changes in the linter-eslint plugin settings
          as shown below. Additionally, you should run <code>npm get prefix</code> and input the result into the <strong>Global Node Installation Path</strong> box.</p><img src="assets/stylelint2.png" class="node sty">
        <h4 id="autop">Autoprefixer</h4>
        <p>Beyond <strong>linters</strong>, an <strong>autoprefixer</strong> will be your new best friend. You'll never have to hardcode <strong>vendor prefixes</strong> again. By simply running <code>apm install autoprefixer</code> and setting it to prefix
          on save, you can simply code, save and <strong>vendor prefixes</strong> will be prefixed automagically.</p>
        <p>That’s it for the web developer starter pack. These tools will help you establish an efficient workflow and save you time and cognitive load to work on other less trivial issues as opposed to figuring out <strong>vendor prefixes</strong> for random
          properties.

        <h3 id="src">💭 My First Open Source Contribution 💭</h3>
        <span id="src-txt"><p>Hey <span class="hacker">hackers!</span><br> <a href="mailto:me@l0rdcafe.com" class="l0rd">l0rdcafé</a> here. This post is about <b>version control</b>, how I learned <b>git</b> and in turn my first open source contribution.
        Up until then, my technical proficiency with <b>version control</b> was limited. I had a basic workflow to initialize a <b>repository</b>, add files, <b>commit changes</b> and <b>push repositories</b> to a remote server, in my case
        <a href="http://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a> but that was about it.</p>
        <p>My <b>git workflow</b> was a product of the aforementioned <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/git-tutorial" target="_blank">Learn Enough tutorial on version control</a>, <a href="https://guides.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub’s Guides</a>          and trial and error within reasonable limits. Until one day after updating my <b>tech stack</b>, <a href="#newdev">(more on that to come later!)</a> and getting <a href="http://browsersync.io/" target="http://browsersync.io/">browser-sync</a>,
          which starts a <b>local</b> web server that updates browser on file changes. I noticed the <a href="https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr" target="_blank">tldr</a> pages were missing a page for <a href="http://browsersync.io" target="_blank">browser-sync</a>          after needing to look up some syntax examples.</p>
        <p>Seeing an opportunity to contribute, I went to the <a href="https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr" target="_blank">GitHub tldr repo</a>, <b>forked</b> a copy from its <b>master branch</b>, and created my one-page contribution to the
          <a href="https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr" target="_blank">tldr</a>. Again, <a href="https://github.com/jellyc0la" target="_blank">jellyc0la’s</a> guidance was invaluable to my success, helping me ensure adherence to the standardized format
          of the <b>tldr pages</b>. Inevitably and due to my inexperience with <b>git</b> as well as the <b>CI server</b>, I committed one too many changes.</p>
        <p>Fearful it might reflect a lack of professionalism, I learned about <b>git rebase</b> with the help of <a href="https://github.com/jellyc0la" target="_blank">jellyc0la</a>, which enables you to alter the history of <b>commits</b> in a variety
          of ways. And after mostly trial and error, tweaking the <b>git log</b>, I <b>pushed</b> my changes for submission. My contribution finally passed the <b>CI</b> and was to be reviewed by the maintainer. Within a day or two, the first maintainer
          approved the changes, and notified the second maintainer to review my <b>pull request</b>. A month later, it was finally approved and my contribution was <b>merged</b> to the <b>master branch</b> of the
          <a href="https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/blob/master/pages/common/browser-sync.md" target="_blank">tldr pages.</a></p>
        <p>In conclusion, even though I was inexperienced with <b>version control</b>; my workflow, technical sophistication and knowledge lacking, my first open source contribution helped me learn more <b>git</b> and gain valuable experience under my belt
          with
          <b>pull requests</b>, <b>forks</b>, <b>git rebase</b> even more than tutorials ever did. And this goes to show that nothing beats immersion when it comes to learning.</p>

        <h3 id="intro">💭 Introduction 💭</h3>
        <span id="intro-txt"><p>Hello, world. At the turn of the year, my hacker buddy <a href="https://github.com/jellyc0la" target="_blank">jellyc0la</a> linked me a series of introductory tutorials titled <a href="http://learnenough.com/" target="_blank">Learn Enough</a>,
                    and ever since I’ve been on a deep dive into the expanding universe of web development. He mentored me through a well-crafted curriculum, starting with front-end web development, and relentlessly emphasizing learning the fundamentals
                    of concepts deeply.</p>
                <p>After covering some basic <b>UNIX command line</b>, basic version control and <b>HTML</b>, next up was <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3" target="_blank">The Odin Project’s HTML5/CSS3</a> course, a great selection
                    of resources and interesting projects. The projects ranged from cloning the Google homepage, to its results page, a YouTube page, an older version of the apple.com homepage and a New York Times article employing a range of concepts
                    like <b>HTML forms,
                    CSS Box Model, Responsive Design with media queries.</b></p>
                <p>Luckily I had <a href="https://github.com/jellyc0la" target="_blank">jellyc0la’s</a> guidance a text away to triple-check my work, which proved the importance of fresh eyes and good mentorship. A particularly painful episode when an extra
                    “/” prevented a YouTube logo to render properly in the header springs to mind.</p>
                <p>Instead of using a framework like <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>, I accumulated enough technical sophistication to build my own <a href="https://github.com/l0rdcafe/cc-ss" target="_blank">cc-ss</a>                    library, using resources such as
                    <a href="http://getskeleton.com/" target="_blank">Skeleton</a>, <a href="http://clrs.cc/" target="_blank">clrs</a>, <a href="http://fontawesome.io/" target="_blank">font-awesome</a>, and <a href="https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/"
                        target="_blank">normalize</a>. Along the way, I read a couple of <a href="http://thesassway.com/" target="_blank">SASS</a> <a href="https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/sass/" target="_blank">tutorials</a> as well that were helpful in
                    writing my framework efficiently. As my knowledge expanded, so did my arsenal of tools. I upgraded from the default <b>Mac Terminal</b> to <a href="https://www.iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a>, decked out my <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom text editor</a>                    with packages and established a streamlined workflow <a href="#newdev">(More on that
                    later!).</a> Most importantly, I ensured daily progress covering new ground and working on at least a project a day.</p>
                <p>The main benefit of deep learning is a better understanding of frameworks, libraries and even languages like <b>SASS</b>, which I found more intuitive after covering main <b>CSS</b> concepts. Beyond <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b>, I’ve read
                    the first couple of chapters of <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/" target="_blank">EloquentJS</a>, a book that is a favorite amongst many programmers.</p>
                <p>Although my current programming sophistication fails to show for any notable achievements, I intend on immersing myself and delving as deep into programming concepts, frameworks, libraries and everything in between as I did before. So
                    stay tuned for the exciting upcoming projects!</p>
