                <h2>🤔 Thoughts 🤔</h2>
                <h3>💭 Introduction 💭</h3>
                <p>Hello, world. At the turn of the year, my hacker buddy jellyc0la linked me a series of introductory tutorials titled Learn Enough, and ever since I’ve been on a deep dive into the expanding universe of web development. He mentored me through
                    a well-crafted curriculum, starting with front-end web development, and relentlessly emphasizing learning the fundamentals of concepts deeply.</p>
                <p>After covering some basic UNIX command line, version control and HTML, next up was The Odin Project’s HTML5/CSS3 course, a great selection of resources and interesting projects. The projects ranged from cloning the Google homepage, to
                    its results page, a YouTube page, an older version of the apple.com homepage and a New York Times article employing a range of concepts like HTML forms, CSS Box Model, Responsive Design with media queries.</p>
                <p>Luckily I had jellyc0la’s guidance a text away to triple-check my work, which proved the importance of fresh eyes and good mentorship. A particularly painful episode when an extra “/” prevented a YouTube logo to render properly in the
                    header springs to mind.</p>
                <p>Instead of using a framework like Bootstrap, I accumulated enough technical sophistication to build my own cc-ss library, using resources such as Skeleton, clrs, font-awesome, and normalize. Along the way, I read a couple of SASS tutorials
                    as well that were helpful in writing my framework efficiently. As my knowledge expanded, so did my arsenal of tools. I upgraded from the default Mac Terminal to iTerm2, decked out my text editor with packages and established a streamlined
                    workflow (More on that later!). Most importantly, I ensured daily progress covering new ground and working on at least a project a day.</p>
                <p>The main benefit of deep learning is a better understanding of frameworks, libraries and even languages like SASS, which I found more intuitive after covering main CSS concepts. Beyond HTML and CSS, I’ve read the first couple of chapters
                    off of EloquentJS, a book that is a favorite amongst many programmers.</p>
                <p>Although my current programming sophistication fails to show for any notable achievements, I intend on immersing myself and delving as deep into programming concepts, frameworks, libraries and everything in between as I did before. So
                    stay tuned for exciting upcoming projects!</p>
                <h3>💭 My First Open Source Contribution 💭</h3>
                <p>Hey hackers, l0rdcafé here. This post is about version control, how I learned git and in turn my first open source contribution. Up until then, my technical proficiency with version control was limited. I had a basic workflow to initialize
                    a repository, add files, commit changes and push repositories to a remote server, in my case GitHub but that was about it.</p>
                <p>My git workflow was a product of the aforementioned Learn Enough tutorial on version control, GitHub’s guidelines and trial and error within reasonable limits. Until one day after updating my tech stack, (more on that to come later!) and
                    getting browser-sync, which starts a local web server that updates browser on file changes. I noticed the tldr pages were missing a page for browser-sync after needing to look up some syntax examples.</p>
                <p>Seeing an opportunity to contribute, I went to the GitHub tldr repo, forked a copy from its master branch, and created my one-page contribution to the tldr. Again, jellyc0la’s guidance was key to my success, helping me ensure adherence
                    to the standardized format of the tldr pages. Inevitably and due to my inexperience with git as well as the CI server, I committed one too many changes.</p>
                <p>Fearful it might reflect a lack of professionalism, I learned about git rebase with the help of jellyc0la, which enables you to alter the history of commits in a variety of ways. And after mostly trial and error, tweaking the commit history,
                    I pushed my changes for submission. My contribution finally passed the CI and was to be reviewed by the maintainer. Within a day or two, the first maintainer approved the changes, and notified the second maintainer to review it. A
                    month later, it was finally approved and my contribution was merged to the master branch of the tldr pages.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, even though I was inexperienced with version control; my workflow, technical sophistication and knowledge lacking, my first open source contribution helped me learn more git and gain valuable experience under my belt with
                    pull requests, forks, git rebase even more than tutorials ever did. And this goes to show that nothing beats immersion when it comes to learning.</p>
                <h3>💭 How To Setup Your Macbook Pro To Be More Efficient for Editing Code (For New Web Devs) 💭</h3>
                <p>Hey hacker friends! It’s l0rdcafé. I fleetingly mentioned the term tech stack in the previous post. Here, we go deeper into that and how to set up a well-organized workflow especially for new web developers on Mac.</p>
                <p>If you’re still using the default Mac Terminal, bin that instantly and download iTerm2. Press Cmd-N, already an improvement, right? If you know some basic UNIX command line and know about the man pages, which are notoriously dizzying to
                    read, then you should start off by installing tldr. Simply run sudo npm install –g tldr, then run tldr echo to see if it works.</p>
                <p>iTerm2 unlike Terminal, is very customizable. So give the preferences a look and toy with the colors. Additionally, you can download preset color schemes from here.</p>
                <p>The default Shell is .bash, which isn’t necessarily the most efficient. That’s where Prezto comes into play, a .zsh framework enriching the command line interface with aliases, sane defaults, prompt themes and most importantly auto completion;
                    a true savior!</p>

                    a true savior!</p>
                <p>Moreover, if you’ve used the cd command you’ll know how linear directory navigation can be. Run brew install fasd and now you can use the command j with any directory that you’ve visited before as its argument to navigate instantly there.</p>
                <p>Writing CSS can be a pain when you have to refresh the page on your browser with each saved change. That’s why browser-sync exists, run sudo npm install –g browser-sync, then tldr browser-sync (Aha!) for examples on how to use it.</p>
                <p>Now it’s time to upgrade your text editor. Personally, I picked Atom and have been using it ever since, so this is going to be catered to that but feel free to look up equivalent upgrades for whatever text editor you end up choosing. Linters
                    are packages installed in a text editor that, given specific settings will clean up your code and pick up on any syntax errors. For the full list, please visit the in-depth .md.</p>
                <p>Beyond linters, an autoprefixer will save you enormous time hardcoding vendor prefixes, by simply running apm install autoprefixer and setting it to prefix on save, you can simply code, save and vendor prefixes will be prefixed automatically.</p>
                <p>That’s it for the web developer starter pack. These tools will help you establish an efficient workflow and save you time and cognitive load to work on other less trivial issues as opposed to figuring out vendor prefixes for random properties.
