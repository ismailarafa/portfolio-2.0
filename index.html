                <h3 id="newdev">💭 How To Setup Your Macbook Pro To Be More Efficient for Editing Code (For New Web Devs) 💭</h3>
                <p>Hey <span class="hacker">hacker friends!</span><br>It’s <span class="l0rd">l0rdcafé</span>. I fleetingly mentioned the term <strong>tech stack</strong> in the previous post. Here, we go deeper into that and how to set up a well-organized
                    workflow especially for new web developers on Mac.</p>

                </ol>
                <p id="itrm">If you’re still using the default <strong>Mac Terminal</strong>, bin that instantly and download <a href="https://iterm2.com/" target="_blank">iTerm2</a>. Press <strong>Cmd-N</strong>, instant improvement, right?</p>
                <p id="itrmclrs"><a href="https://www.iterm2.com/" target="_blank">iTerm2</a> unlike <strong>Terminal</strong>, is very customizable. So give the preferences a look and toy with the colors. Additionally, you can download <a href="http://iterm2colorschemes.com/"
                        target="_blank"> preset color schemes</a>.<img src="images/colors.gif"></p>
                <p id="#brew">Before you go any further, you should install <a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank">Homebrew</a>. It'll give you quick access to a plethora of software by running simple commands, dubbed as the missing package manager for macOS. Copy/paste
                    the command into your terminal.</p>
                <p id="#node">Up next is <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">Node,</a> which after installing <a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank">Homebrew</a> becomes a much simpler task. Run <code>brew install node</code>. Now, run <code>node -v</code>                    to see if it's installed, and then also <code>npm -v</code>. If it is, you should see something similar to this.</p><img src="images/node.png" class="node">
                <p id="#tldr">If you know some basic
                    <strong>UNIX command line</strong> and know about the <code>man</code> pages, which are notoriously dizzying to read, then you should start off by installing <a href="https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr" target="_blank">tldr</a>. Simply
                    run <code>sudo npm install –g tldr</code>, then run <code>tldr echo</code> to see if it works. The <code>sudo</code> prefix might not be necessary, depending on your admin preferences. But if you run the command without it and returns
                    an error, then it will be.
                </p>
                <p id="#zsh">The default <strong>Shell</strong> is <code>.bash</code>, which isn’t necessarily the most efficient. You can tell which <strong>Shell</strong> is running by looking at the top of your terminal window.</p><img src="images/bash.png" class="node">
                <p>That’s where <a href="https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto" target="_blank">Prezto</a> comes into play, a <code>.zsh</code> <strong>framework</strong> enriching the command line interface with <strong>aliases</strong>, <strong>sane defaults</strong>,
                    <strong>prompt themes</strong> and most importantly <strong>auto completion</strong>; a true savior!</p>
                <p>Run <code>zsh</code> to start a <code>.zsh</code> session and follow the installation instructions carefully.</p>
                <p>As with most things, you'll need to customize your <a href="https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto" target="_blank">Prezto</a> modules. So go to your home directory by running <code>cd</code>, then run <code>ls -a</code> and check to
                    see if there's a <code>.zpreztorc</code>. If there is and there should be, open that file in your <strong> text editor</strong>and make sure the modules from line 26 to 44 are in the following order.</p><img src="images/module.png"
                    class="node">
                <p id="#j">Moreover, if you’ve used the <code>cd</code> command enough, you’ll know how consuming directory navigation can be. Run <code>brew install fasd</code> and now you can use the command <code>j</code> with any <strong>directory</strong> that
                    you’ve visited before as its <strong>argument</strong> to navigate instantly there. Here's an example of it in action.</p><img src="images/fasd.gif" class="node">
                <p id="#brwsr">Writing <strong>CSS</strong> can be a pain when you have to refresh the page on your browser with each saved change. That’s why <a href="https://browsersync.io/" target="_blank">browser-sync</a> exists, run <code>sudo npm install –g browser-sync</code>,
                    then <code>tldr browser-sync</code> (<a href="#src">Aha!</a>) for examples on how to use it.</p><img src="images/browser-sync.gif" class="node">
                <p id="#lntrs">Now it’s time to upgrade your <strong>text editor</strong>. Personally, I picked <a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank">Atom</a> at the start and have been using it ever since, so this is going to be catered to that but feel free to
                    look up equivalent upgrades for whatever <strong>text editor</strong> you end up choosing. <strong>Linters</strong> are packages installed in a <strong>text editor</strong> that, given specific settings will clean up your code and
                    pick up on any syntax errors. This is a pretty long list, since you have to install <strong>linters</strong> for each language. However, I highly advise against copy/pasting and to actually type in each command.</p><code class="lntr">apm install linter-csslint<br>apm install linter-htmlhint<br>apm install linter-jsonlint<br>apm install linter-scss-lint<br>apm install linter-markdown<br>apm install linter-eslint<br>apm install linter-stylefmt<br>apm install linter-write-good<br>apm install atom-beautify<br>apm install git-diff<br>apm install jquery<br>apm install pigments<br>apm install file-type-icons<br>apm install open-recent</code>
                <p>You will need to customize some of these plugins. Firstly, create a <code>~/.eslintrc</code> file and write the following in it.</p><img src="images/eslintrc.png" class="node">
                <p>Then your beautify settings should match those in the following image.</p><img src="images/beautify.png" class="node">
                <p>You'll also need to tick the box for Use global ESLint installation as well as specify the <strong>.eslintrc Path</strong> to the <code>~/.eslintrc</code> file created earlier. You can implement these changes in the linter-eslint plugin
                    settings as shown below. Additionally, you should run <code>npm get prefix</code> and input the result into the <strong>Global Node Installation Path</strong> box</p><img src="images/stylelint2.png" class="node sty">
                <p id="#autop">Beyond <strong>linters</strong>, an <strong>autoprefixer</strong> will be your new best friend. You'll never have to hardcode <strong>vendor prefixes</strong> again. By simply running <code>apm install autoprefixer</code> and setting it
                    to prefix on save, you can simply code, save and <strong>vendor prefixes</strong> will be prefixed automagically.</p>
                <p>That’s it for the web developer starter pack. These tools will help you establish an efficient workflow and save you time and cognitive load to work on other less trivial issues as opposed to figuring out <strong>vendor prefixes</strong>                    for random properties.

                <h3 id="src">💭 My First Open Source Contribution 💭</h3>
                <p>Hey <span class="hacker">hackers!</span><br> <span class="l0rd">l0rdcafé</span> here. This post is about <b>version control</b>, how I learned <b>git</b> and in turn my first open source contribution. Up until then, my technical proficiency
                    with <b>version control</b> was limited. I had a basic workflow to initialize a <b>repository</b>, add files, <b>commit changes</b> and <b>push repositories</b> to a remote server, in my case <a href="http://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a>                    but that was about it.</p>
                <p>My <b>git workflow</b> was a product of the aforementioned <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/git-tutorial" target="_blank">Learn Enough tutorial on version control</a>, <a href="https://guides.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub’s Guides</a>                    and trial and error within reasonable limits. Until one day after updating my <b>tech stack</b>, (<a href="#newdev">more on that to come later!</a>) and getting <a href="http://browsersync.io/" target="http://browsersync.io/">browser-sync</a>,
                    which starts a <b>local</b> web <em>server</em> that updates browser on file changes. I noticed the <a href="https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr" target="_blank">tldr</a> pages were missing a page for <a href="http://browsersync.io"
                        target="_blank">browser-sync</a> after needing to look up some syntax examples.</p>
                <p>Seeing an opportunity to contribute, I went to the <a href="https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr" target="_blank">GitHub tldr repo</a>, <b>forked</b> a copy from its <b>master branch</b>, and created my one-page contribution to the <a href="https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr"
                        target="_blank">tldr</a>. Again, <a href="https://github.com/jellyc0la" target="_blank">jellyc0la’s</a> guidance was invaluable to my success, helping me ensure adherence to the standardized format of the <b>tldr pages</b>. Inevitably
                    and due to my inexperience with <b>git</b> as well as the <b>CI server</b>, I committed one too many changes.</p>
                <p>Fearful it might reflect a lack of professionalism, I learned about <b>git rebase</b> with the help of <a href="https://github.com/jellyc0la" target="_blank">jellyc0la</a>, which enables you to alter the history of <b>commits</b> in a
                    variety of ways. And after mostly trial and error, tweaking the <b>git log</b>, I <b>pushed</b> my changes for submission. My contribution finally passed the <b>CI</b> and was to be reviewed by the maintainer. Within a day or two,
                    the first maintainer approved the changes, and notified the second maintainer to review my <b>pull request</b>. A month later, it was finally approved and my contribution was <b>merged</b> to the <b>master branch</b> of the <a href="https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/blob/master/pages/common/browser-sync.md"
                        target="_blank">tldr pages.</a></p>
                <p>In conclusion, even though I was inexperienced with <b>version control</b>; my workflow, technical sophistication and knowledge lacking, my first open source contribution helped me learn more <b>git</b> and gain valuable experience under
                    my belt with
                    <b>pull requests</b>, <b>forks</b>, <b>git rebase</b> even more than tutorials ever did. And this goes to show that nothing beats immersion when it comes to learning.</p>
                <small>April 27, 2017</small>
                <h3>💭 Introduction 💭</h3>
                <p>Hello, world. At the turn of the year, my hacker buddy <a href="https://github.com/jellyc0la" target="_blank">jellyc0la</a> linked me a series of introductory tutorials titled <a href="http://learnenough.com/" target="_blank">Learn Enough</a>,
                    and ever since I’ve been on a deep dive into the expanding universe of web development. He mentored me through a well-crafted curriculum, starting with front-end web development, and relentlessly emphasizing learning the fundamentals
                    of concepts deeply.</p>
                <p>After covering some basic <b>UNIX command line</b>, basic version control and <b>HTML</b>, next up was <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3" target="_blank">The Odin Project’s HTML5/CSS3</a> course, a great selection
                    of resources and interesting projects. The projects ranged from cloning the Google homepage, to its results page, a YouTube page, an older version of the apple.com homepage and a New York Times article employing a range of concepts
                    like <b>HTML forms,
                    CSS Box Model, Responsive Design with media queries.</b></p>
                <p>Luckily I had <a href="https://github.com/jellyc0la" target="_blank">jellyc0la’s</a> guidance a text away to triple-check my work, which proved the importance of fresh eyes and good mentorship. A particularly painful episode when an extra
                    “/” prevented a YouTube logo to render properly in the header springs to mind.</p>
                <p>Instead of using a framework like <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>, I accumulated enough technical sophistication to build my own <a href="https://github.com/ismailarafa/cc-ss" target="_blank">cc-ss</a>                    library, using resources such as
                    <a href="http://getskeleton.com/" target="_blank">Skeleton</a>, <a href="http://clrs.cc/" target="_blank">clrs</a>, <a href="http://fontawesome.io/" target="_blank">font-awesome</a>, and <a href="https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/"
                        target="_blank">normalize</a>. Along the way, I read a couple of <a href="http://thesassway.com/" target="_blank">SASS</a> <a href="https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/sass/" target="_blank">tutorials</a> as well that were helpful in
                    writing my framework efficiently. As my knowledge expanded, so did my arsenal of tools. I upgraded from the default <b>Mac Terminal</b> to <a href="https://www.iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a>, decked out my <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom text editor</a>                    with packages and established a streamlined workflow (<a href="#newdev">More on that
                    later!</a>). Most importantly, I ensured daily progress covering new ground and working on at least a project a day.</p>
                <p>The main benefit of deep learning is a better understanding of frameworks, libraries and even languages like <b>SASS</b>, which I found more intuitive after covering main <b>CSS</b> concepts. Beyond <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b>, I’ve read
                    the first couple of chapters of <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/" target="_blank">EloquentJS</a>, a book that is a favorite amongst many programmers.</p>
                <p>Although my current programming sophistication fails to show for any notable achievements, I intend on immersing myself and delving as deep into programming concepts, frameworks, libraries and everything in between as I did before. So
                    stay tuned for exciting upcoming projects!</p>
