<p><p>Hey <span class="main__body__content__span">hackers!</span> <a href="mailto:me@l0rdcafe.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">l0rdcafé</a> here. This post is about <strong>version control</strong>, how I learned <strong>git</strong> and in turn my first open source contribution. Up until then, my technical proficiency with <strong>version control</strong> was limited. I had a basic workflow to initialize a <strong>repository</strong>, add files, <strong>commit changes</strong> and <strong>push repositories</strong> to a remote server, in my case <a href="http://github.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> but that was about it.</p>
<p>My <strong>git workflow</strong> was a product of the aforementioned <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/git-tutorial" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learn Enough tutorial on version control</a>, <a href="https://guides.github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub’s Guides</a> and trial and error within reasonable limits. Until one day after updating my <strong>tech stack</strong>, <a href="#newdev">(more on that to come later!)</a> and getting <a href="http://browsersync.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">browser-sync</a>, which starts a <strong>local</strong> web server that updates browser on file changes. I noticed the <a href="https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tldr</a> pages were missing a page for <a href="http://browsersync.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">browser-sync</a> after needing to look up some syntax examples.</p>
<p>Seeing an opportunity to contribute, I went to the <a href="https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub tldr repo</a>, <strong>forked</strong> a copy from its <strong>master branch</strong>, and created my one-page contribution to the <a href="https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tldr</a>. Again, <a href="https://github.com/jellyc0la" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jellyc0la’s</a> guidance was invaluable to my success, helping me ensure adherence to the standardized format of the <strong>tldr pages</strong>. Inevitably and due to my inexperience with <strong>git</strong> as well as the <strong>CI server</strong>, I committed one too many changes.</p>
<p>Fearful it might reflect a lack of professionalism, I learned about <strong>git rebase</strong> with the help of <a href="https://github.com/jellyc0la" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jellyc0la</a>, which enables you to alter the history of <strong>commits</strong> in a variety of ways. And after mostly trial and error, tweaking the <strong>git log</strong>, I <strong>pushed</strong> my changes for submission. My contribution finally passed the <strong>CI</strong> and was to be reviewed by the maintainer. Within a day or two, the first maintainer approved the changes, and notified the second maintainer to review my <strong>pull request</strong>. A month later, it was finally approved and my contribution was <strong>merged</strong> to the <strong>master branch</strong> of the <a href="https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/blob/master/pages/common/browser-sync.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tldr pages.</a></p>
<p>In conclusion, even though I was inexperienced with <strong>version control</strong>; my workflow, technical sophistication and knowledge lacking, my first open source contribution helped me learn more <strong>git</strong> and gain valuable experience under my belt with <strong>pull requests</strong>, <strong>forks</strong>, <strong>git rebase</strong> even more than tutorials ever did. And this goes to show that nothing beats immersion when it comes to learning.</p>
