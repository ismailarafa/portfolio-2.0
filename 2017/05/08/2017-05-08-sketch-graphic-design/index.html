    <div class="main__body__section--content"><h1>💭 Hacking Graphic Design or Sketch for Devs 💭</h1>
<p><p>Hey <span class="main__body__content__span">hackers</span>,<span class="main__body__content__span">designers</span> and <span class="main__body__content__span">design hackers.</span> It’s your boy <a href="mailto:me@l0rdcafe.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">l0rdcafe</a>. This post is a brief overview of my experience learning graphic design basics with <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sketch.</a> I’ll be going through what I learned, built, and how useful these new skills are.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sketchapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sketch</a> is a lighter and more affordable alternative to <a href="http://www.adobe.com/ca/products/photoshop.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adobe Photoshop.</a> <a href="https://www,sketchapp.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sketch</a> simplifies some tasks that otherwise would be rather complicated to execute in other applications.</p>
<p>It’s also an extremely light application and moreover, allows you to copy the <strong>CSS</strong> of any <strong>asset</strong> to the clipboard and paste it to a <strong>text editor</strong>. Compared to <a href="http://www.adobe.com/ca/products/photoshop.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Photoshop</a> or other graphic design software, the <strong>CSS</strong> given by <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sketch</a> is incredibly clean, easily readable and concise.</p>
<p>Secondly,I used <a href="https://www.lynda.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lynda</a> to complete a series of 4 <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sketch</a> courses. Starting off with <a href="https://www.lynda.com/Sketch-tutorials/Learn-Sketch-Basics/450912-2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sketch Essential Training: The Basics,</a> and designing the mockup website with the instructor using the downloadable exercise files. I quickly picked up on the basics of <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sketch</a> and hardly found anything too cumbersome to do.</p>
<p>From creating <strong>artboards, to drawing vector icons, creating symbols,</strong> and finally building a responsive website for 4 devices. This course covered the essential <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sketch</a> basics to be able to create, edit and export <strong>assets</strong> for web development or other purposes.</p>
<p>Afterwards, I completed the <a href="https://www.lynda.com/Sketch-tutorials/Learn-Sketch-Creating-Vector-Graphics/496907-2.html?srchtrk=index%3a11%0alinktypeid%3a2%0aq%3asketch%0apage%3a1%0as%3arelevance%0asa%3atrue%0aproducttypeid%3a2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sketch: Creating Vector Graphics</a> course, which gets more into <strong>vector graphics</strong> in terms of drawing, editing, custom borders, <strong>Bezier vectors, Boolean operations</strong> and that culminated in building an average navigation toolbar.</p>
<p>The penultimate course named the <a href="https://www.lynda.com/Sketch-tutorials/Learn-Sketch-Style-Guides-Pattern-Libraries/496908-2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sketch: Style Guides &amp; Asset Libraries</a> concerned <strong>style guides, asset libraries</strong> and how to manage and build them both efficiently as well as professionally. By the end of the course, I’d learned how to build my own <strong>asset library</strong> by combining other libraries, how to properly name <strong>assets</strong> and organize them in case of collaborative work, and finally how to share <strong>asset libraries</strong> with others.</p>
<p>Lastly, <a href="https://www.lynda.com/Sketch-tutorials/UX-Design-Tools-Sketch/505807-2.html?srchtrk=index%3a1%0alinktypeid%3a2%0aq%3asketch+ux+design%0apage%3a1%0as%3arelevance%0asa%3atrue%0aproducttypeid%3a2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sketch for UX Design</a> was the last course I finished and it was almost an aggregate of all the aforementioned skills giving a broad outline of <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sketch</a> and how it can be utilized to build for a range of devices including the likes of <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/watch/?afid=p238%7CsiRW00CTe-dc_mtid_2092506t42625_pcrid_187244146446_&amp;cid=wwa-ca-kwgo-watch-slid-" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple Watch</a>. Also, the course gets into several <strong>plugins,</strong> <a href="https://www.sketchappsources.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sketch App Sources</a> and how the <a href="http://sketchtoolbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sketch Toolbox</a> can be used to install a plethora of <strong>plugins</strong> created by the vibrant <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com/community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sketch community.</a></p>
<p>To wrap up, <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sketch</a> is an impressively user-friendly tool that allows <span class="main__body__content__span">designers,</span> and <span class="main__body__content__span">developers</span></p>
<p> to quickly draw up <strong>mockups</strong>, create <strong>icons,</strong> <strong>assets, asset libraries,</strong> among numerous other functions. With my newly-acquired <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sketch</a> nous, I made a fairly simple <a href="mailto:me@l0rdcafe.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">l0rdcafe</a> logo <a href="#nav">(See?)</a> as well as a mockup responsive design of a website for a fictional app for 4 devices in the <a href="#uber">projects</a> section.</p>
