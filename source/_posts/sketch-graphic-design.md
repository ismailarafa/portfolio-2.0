Hey <span class="main__body__content__span">hackers</span>, <span class="main__body__content__span">designers</span> and <span class="main__body__content__span">design hackers.</span> It's your boy [l0rdcafe](mailto:me@l0rdcafe.com). This post is a brief overview of my experience learning graphic design basics with [Sketch.](https://www.sketchapp.com/) I'll be going through what I learned, built, and how useful these new skills are.

[Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) is a lighter and more affordable alternative to [Adobe Photoshop.](http://www.adobe.com/ca/products/photoshop.html) [Sketch](https://www,sketchapp.com) simplifies some tasks that otherwise would be rather complicated to execute in other applications.

It's also an extremely light application and moreover, allows you to copy the **CSS** of any **asset** to the clipboard and paste it to a **text editor**. Compared to [Photoshop](http://www.adobe.com/ca/products/photoshop.html) or other graphic design software, the **CSS** given by [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com) is incredibly clean, easily readable and concise.

Secondly, I used [Lynda](https://www.lynda.com/) to complete a series of 4 [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com) courses. Starting off with [Sketch Essential Training: The Basics,](https://www.lynda.com/Sketch-tutorials/Learn-Sketch-Basics/450912-2.html) and designing the mockup website with the instructor using the downloadable exercise files. I quickly picked up on the basics of [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com) and hardly found anything too cumbersome to do.

From creating **artboards, to drawing vector icons, creating symbols,** and finally building a responsive website for 4 devices. This course covered the essential [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com) basics to be able to create, edit and export **assets** for web development or other purposes.

Afterwards, I completed the [Sketch: Creating Vector Graphics](https://www.lynda.com/Sketch-tutorials/Learn-Sketch-Creating-Vector-Graphics/496907-2.html?srchtrk=index%3a11%0alinktypeid%3a2%0aq%3asketch%0apage%3a1%0as%3arelevance%0asa%3atrue%0aproducttypeid%3a2) course, which gets more into **vector graphics** in terms of drawing, editing, custom borders, **Bezier vectors, Boolean operations** and that culminated in building an average navigation toolbar.

The penultimate course named the [Sketch: Style Guides & Asset Libraries](https://www.lynda.com/Sketch-tutorials/Learn-Sketch-Style-Guides-Pattern-Libraries/496908-2.html) concerned **style guides, asset libraries** and how to manage and build them both efficiently as well as professionally. By the end of the course, I'd learned how to build my own **asset library** by combining other libraries, how to properly name **assets** and organize them in case of collaborative work, and finally how to share **asset libraries** with others.

Lastly, [Sketch for UX Design](https://www.lynda.com/Sketch-tutorials/UX-Design-Tools-Sketch/505807-2.html?srchtrk=index%3a1%0alinktypeid%3a2%0aq%3asketch+ux+design%0apage%3a1%0as%3arelevance%0asa%3atrue%0aproducttypeid%3a2) was the last course I finished and it was almost an aggregate of all the aforementioned skills giving a broad outline of [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com) and how it can be utilized to build for a range of devices including the likes of [Apple Watch](https://www.apple.com/ca/watch/?afid=p238%7CsiRW00CTe-dc_mtid_2092506t42625_pcrid_187244146446_&cid=wwa-ca-kwgo-watch-slid-). Also, the course gets into several **plugins,** [Sketch App Sources](https://www.sketchappsources.com/) and how the [Sketch Toolbox](http://sketchtoolbox.com/) can be used to install a plethora of **plugins** created by the vibrant [Sketch community.](https://www.sketchapp.com/community/)

To wrap up, [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com) is an impressively user-friendly tool that allows <span class="main__body__content__span">designers,</span> and <span class="main__body__content__span">developers</span>

 to quickly draw up **mockups**, create **icons,** **assets, asset libraries,** among numerous other functions. With my newly-acquired [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com) nous, I made a fairly simple [l0rdcafe](mailto:me@l0rdcafe.com) logo [(See?)](#nav) as well as a mockup responsive design of a website for a fictional app for 4 devices in the [projects](#uber) section.
