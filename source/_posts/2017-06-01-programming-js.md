Hey <span class="main__body__content__span">hacker friends!</span> Ur fam; [l0rdcafe](mailto:me@l0rdcafe.com) here. This installment is about **JavaScript**, or in other words my first foray into proper programming.

Two weeks ago, I had little to no programming experience whatsoever. I'd read a few tutorials and seen some **JavaScript** syntax, enough to scare me away from programming for browsers. However, I decided it was time to face my fears and program for the web.

I started off by reading and doing the [exercises](http://asmarterwaytolearn.com/js/index-of-exercises.html) for [A Smarter Way To Learn: JavaScript by Mark Myers](http://www.asmarterwaytolearn.com/); a quick and to the point programming book that teaches you the foundations of the language whilst maintaining basic practicality. After finishing the book, I signed up and completed the [Practical JavaScript](https://watchandcode.com/p/practical-javascript) course at [Watch and Code,](https://watchandcode.com/) building a basic to-do list with the instructor. Where he goes into thorough explanation of all aspects of the program in an intuitive and practical way.

Beyond the [Watch and Code tutorial,](https://watchandcode.com/p/practical-javascript) I decided to implement some extra features to the application like **expired items, urgent items, item counters** and other **UI features.** That proved to be the most educational part of the process as I encountered every programmer's best friends; **bugs.**

I quickly learned that you constantly need to maintain a _readable, consistent_ and **focused codebase** to simplify **debugging**, adding features and most of all avoid mistakes. Moreover, I also learned that **refactoring** is necessary as a program gets bigger, and the usage of **helper methods** and/or **functions** comes into play much more prominently as an application expands.

One of the more challenging undertakings of the application was **date validation**, but from Mark Myers' e-mail address validation explanation in [A Smarter Way To Learn: JavaScript,](http://www.asmarterwaytolearn.com/) some stubbornness, and a lot of persistence, I managed to validate the date input to the desired format and also list items as either **'Urgent'** or **'Expired'** according to their due dates.

Another essential ally in my programming endeavor was a browser's **debugger** and **console**. Using the **debugger** to pause the program at specific points to catch **bugs,** going through the program line and line, stepping in and out of **functions,** and examining the program's behavior. As well as **logging variables, calling functions** and others in the **console** to ensure everything runs, as it ought to.

Finally, and after much effort I had finished my [2-Do List](#2-do) with the features and functionality that I intended it to have. I've always disliked boasting, but I got to say that I do feel proud in this first moment of programming victory.
