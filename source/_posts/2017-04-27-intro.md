Hello, world. At the turn of the year, my hacker buddy [jellyc0la](https://github.com/jellyc0la) linked me a series of introductory tutorials titled [Learn Enough](http://learnenough.com/), and ever since I've been on a deep dive into the expanding universe of web development. He mentored me through a well-crafted curriculum, starting with front-end web development, and relentlessly emphasizing learning the fundamentals of concepts deeply.

After covering some basic **UNIX command line**, basic version control and **HTML**, next up was [The Odin Project's HTML5/CSS3](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3) course, a great selection of resources and interesting projects. The projects ranged from cloning the Google homepage, to its results page, a YouTube page, an older version of the apple.com homepage and a New York Times article employing a range of concepts like **HTML forms, CSS Box Model, Responsive Design with media queries.**

Luckily I had [jellyc0la's](https://github.com/jellyc0la) guidance a text away to triple-check my work, which proved the importance of fresh eyes and good mentorship. A particularly painful episode when an extra "/" prevented a YouTube logo to render properly in the header springs to mind.

Instead of using a framework like [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), I accumulated enough technical sophistication to build my own [cc-ss](https://github.com/l0rdcafe/cc-ss) library, using resources such as [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/), [clrs](http://clrs.cc/), [font-awesome](http://fontawesome.io/), and [normalize](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/). Along the way, I read a couple of [SASS](http://thesassway.com/) [tutorials](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/sass/) as well that were helpful in writing my framework efficiently. As my knowledge expanded, so did my arsenal of tools. I upgraded from the default **Mac Terminal** to [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/), decked out my [Atom text editor](https://atom.io/) with packages and established a streamlined workflow [(More on that later!).](#newdev) Most importantly, I ensured daily progress covering new ground and working on at least a project a day.

The main benefit of deep learning is a better understanding of frameworks, libraries and even languages like **SASS**, which I found more intuitive after covering main **CSS** concepts. Beyond **HTML** and **CSS**, I've read the first couple of chapters of [EloquentJS](http://eloquentjavascript.net/), a book that is a favorite amongst many programmers.

Although my current programming sophistication fails to show for any notable achievements, I intend on immersing myself and delving as deep into programming concepts, frameworks, libraries and everything in between as I did before. So stay tuned for the exciting upcoming projects!
